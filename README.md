# DAlTON
This is a project I made for my second semester CS Class.  It demonstrates OOP and many different concepts like sorting algorithms, linked lists, generics, interfaces, abstraction, inheritance, and aggregation.

### Project Info
DAlTON is designed for a very specific purpose in mind and requires a bit of context to explain.  I work at a scout camp over the summer and the logistics for providing the proper resources from week to week are a bit complicated.  Our camp has three separate hills that we use for units that stay for a week and the numbers can be wildly different for what we need.  For example, there may need to be 10 tents and 30 cots up one week and 22 tents and 50 cots the next.  This program is designed to simplify the process by inputting what each unit in a site needs for a week and then using a recursive algorithm to find the easiest way to move supplies within each hill.  
It is a very niche project, but demonstrates a wide variety of basic skills and concepts.

### Usage
Simply use the included `makefile` to build and run the project with `make run`.
